description: Subagent-driven quality gate between execution batches/waves
argument-hint: "<spec-name> [--scope batch|wave|phase]"
---

<objective>
Validate that the executed batch truly meets spec intent, code quality, and integration safety before moving forward.
</objective>

<model_policy>
Resolve models from `.spec-workflow/spw-config.toml` `[models]`:
- complex_reasoning -> default `opus`
- implementation -> default `sonnet`
</model_policy>

<subagents>
- `evidence-collector` (model: implementation)
  - Collects task state, test/lint/typecheck outputs, and implementation logs.
- `traceability-judge` (model: complex_reasoning)
  - Verifies requirements/design/tasks alignment for delivered changes.
- `release-gate-decider` (model: complex_reasoning)
  - Produces final PASS/BLOCKED decision and corrective actions.
</subagents>

<workflow>
1. Dispatch `evidence-collector`.
2. Dispatch `traceability-judge` using collected evidence.
3. Dispatch `release-gate-decider`.
4. Generate `.spec-workflow/specs/<spec-name>/CHECKPOINT-REPORT.md` with:
   - status: PASS | BLOCKED
   - critical issues
   - corrective actions
   - recommended next step
</workflow>

<gate_rule>
If status is BLOCKED, do not proceed to the next batch/wave.
</gate_rule>

<completion_guidance>
On PASS:
- Show concise go/no-go summary and recommend next command: `spw:exec <spec-name>` (next batch/wave).

On BLOCKED:
- Show critical issues first, with exact corrective actions.
- Recommend remediation command(s) and rerun: `spw:checkpoint <spec-name>`.
</completion_guidance>
