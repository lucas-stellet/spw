# ===============================================================
# SPW Configuration
# ===============================================================
# This file centralizes behavior for the hybrid workflow
# (spec-workflow + SPW commands + subagent execution).
#
# How to use:
# 1) Copy this file into your real project at:
#    .spec-workflow/spw-config.toml
# 2) Register the SessionStart hook to run the sync script.
# 3) On every Claude session start, the active tasks template
#    will be automatically aligned with this configuration.
#
# Important note:
# - This file does NOT replace requirements/design/tasks artifacts.
# - It controls runtime behavior for commands and hooks, including
#   model routing policy for subagents.
# ===============================================================

[models]
# Model routing policy used by SPW commands.
#
# web_research:
# - Use for lightweight web search/lookup/scouting only.
# - Recommended default: "haiku"
web_research = "haiku"

# complex_reasoning:
# - Use for architecture synthesis, validation gates, and high-risk decisions.
# - Recommended default: "opus"
complex_reasoning = "opus"

# implementation:
# - Use for code-oriented implementation and standard drafting/writing tasks.
# - Recommended default: "sonnet"
implementation = "sonnet"

[execution]
# tdd_default defines the default TDD behavior for the project.
#
# false:
# - TDD is off by default (opt-in model).
# - TDD is used only when a task explicitly sets `TDD: required`
#   or when you change this config to true.
#
# true:
# - TDD is on by default.
# - Tasks using `TDD: inherit` will require a RED->GREEN cycle.
#
# Recommended starting value for your setup: false.
tdd_default = false

# If true, the executor requires minimum RED->GREEN evidence
# for tasks with active TDD (for example: test fails first, then passes).
# This avoids "tests written after the fact" without discipline.
tdd_require_red_green_evidence = true

# If true, the executor blocks batch/wave progression when it finds:
# - missing requirements traceability
# - missing per-task verification
# - critical checkpoint failures
strict_gates = true

# If true, `spw:exec` must pause after each wave/checkpoint PASS and ask the user
# whether to continue to the next wave. No automatic wave progression is allowed.
#
# true  -> explicit user authorization required between waves
# false -> command may auto-continue based on workflow policy
#
# Recommended default: true (human-in-the-loop control).

[subagents]
# Max number of parallel subagents for web scouting tasks.
# Keep this moderate to avoid noisy/duplicated findings.

[skills]
# Enables skill-aware behavior in SPW commands.
#
# true  -> commands try to load skills listed below before key phases
# false -> commands skip skill loading behavior

# Enforcement mode for required skills:
#
# - "advisory": if a required skill is missing, warn and continue.
# - "strict":   if a required skill is missing, block the stage.
#
# Recommended default: "advisory"
enforcement = "advisory"

# `.claude/skills/` from local/global skill directories when available.
# Missing skills do not fail installation.

# - elixir-anti-patterns: smell detection and safer alternatives
# - phoenix-thinking: LiveView/controller/socket guidance

# Supported values:
# - "auto": decide from [execution].tdd_default

# "auto" is recommended to keep a single source of truth
# in execution.tdd_default.
