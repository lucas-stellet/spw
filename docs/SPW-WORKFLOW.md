# SPW Workflow

This file is intentionally lightweight.

The canonical workflow/usage documentation is centralized in:
- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

Latest behavior updates (for example, unfinished-run handling in `spw:design-research`) are documented only in `README.md`.

Use this file only as an entry point when someone opens `docs/` first.

## Go to the source of truth

- Main guide: `README.md`
- Agent/contributor rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Runtime defaults: `config/spw-config.toml`
