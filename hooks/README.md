# SPW Hooks

This file is intentionally lightweight.

Hooks reference:
- Source of truth: `README.md`
- Agent/contributor rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Runtime hook settings: `.spec-workflow/spw-config.toml` (`[hooks]` section)

SPW CLI update behavior (self-update of `spw` wrapper plus cache purge/refresh) is tracked in `README.md`.

Hook scripts live in this folder (`hooks/*.js`, `hooks/*.sh`).
