# SPW Hooks

This file is intentionally lightweight.

Hooks reference:
- Source of truth: `README.md`
- Agent/contributor rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Runtime hook settings: `.spec-workflow/spw-config.toml` (`[hooks]` section)

Behavior changes for SPW commands (including `spw:design-research` unfinished-run flow) are tracked in `README.md`.

Hook scripts live in this folder (`hooks/*.js`, `hooks/*.sh`).
