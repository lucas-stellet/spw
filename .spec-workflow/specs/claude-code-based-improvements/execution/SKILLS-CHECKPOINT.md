# SKILLS-CHECKPOINT.md

## Required Skills (from config)

- **Required**: `conventional-commits`
- **Optional**: `test-driven-development`

## Implementation

The checkpoint audit will verify whether the completed tasks (1, 2, 5) used the required skills appropriately. The subagents will report on skills_used/skkills_missing in their status.json.

## Note

The `conventional-commits` skill is not installed locally. Subagents should verify if commit messages follow conventional commit format during their review.
