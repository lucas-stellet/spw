# Pipeline Dispatch Pattern

Sequential chain of subagents where each produces output that feeds the next.
A synthesizer at the end consolidates everything into the command's final artifact.

## Thin-Dispatch Rules

These rules are mandatory for all pipeline commands. They override any command-specific behavior.

### 1. Status-Only Reads

After dispatching any subagent, read ONLY `<subagent>/status.json`.
- If `status=pass`: proceed to next step.
- If `status=blocked`: read `<subagent>/report.md` to decide action (log + skip, or stop BLOCKED).
- Never read `report.md` when status is pass.

### 2. Path-Based Briefs

When subagent-B depends on output from subagent-A:
- Write the **filesystem path** to `subagent-A/report.md` in `subagent-B/brief.md`.
- Never copy or summarize report content into the brief.

Example brief content:
```
## Inputs
- Scope analysis: <run-dir>/qa-scope-analyst/report.md
- Requirements: .spec-workflow/specs/<spec-name>/requirements.md
```

### 3. Synthesizer Reads From Filesystem

The last subagent (synthesizer/writer) receives a brief listing ALL previous report paths.
It reads them directly from disk — the orchestrator does not relay content.

### 4. Run Structure

```
<phase>/_comms/<command>/run-NNN/
  <subagent-1>/brief.md, report.md, status.json
  <subagent-2>/brief.md, report.md, status.json
  <synthesizer>/brief.md, report.md, status.json
  _handoff.md
```

### 5. Resume Policy

On `continue-unfinished`:
- Skip subagents where `status.json` exists with `status=pass`.
- Redispatch missing or blocked subagents.
- Always rerun synthesizer.

## Extension Points

Pipeline commands may inject logic at these points:

- **`pre_pipeline`**: After resolving spec dir and reading config, before first dispatch. Use for user intent gates, preflight checks, skill loading.
- **`pre_dispatch(<subagent>)`**: Before writing a specific subagent's brief. Use for conditional dispatch (e.g., selecting which designer to run based on a gate decision).
- **`post_dispatch(<subagent>)`**: After reading a subagent's status.json. Use for mid-pipeline decisions that affect subsequent dispatches.
- **`post_pipeline`**: After synthesizer completes, before writing _handoff.md. Use for artifact generation, approval reconciliation, completion guidance.
