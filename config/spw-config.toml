# ===============================================================
# SPW Configuration
# ===============================================================
# This file centralizes behavior for the hybrid workflow
# (spec-workflow + SPW commands + subagent execution).
#
# How to use:
# 1) Copy this file into your real project at:
#    .spec-workflow/spw-config.toml
# 2) Register the SessionStart hook to run the sync script.
# 3) On every Claude session start, the active tasks template
#    will be automatically aligned with this configuration.
#
# Important note:
# - This file does NOT replace requirements/design/tasks artifacts.
# - It controls runtime behavior for commands and hooks, including
#   model routing policy for subagents.
# ===============================================================

[models]
# Model routing policy used by SPW commands.
#
# web_research:
# - Use for lightweight web search/lookup/scouting only.
# - Recommended default: "haiku"
web_research = "haiku"

# complex_reasoning:
# - Use for architecture synthesis, validation gates, and high-risk decisions.
# - Recommended default: "opus"
complex_reasoning = "opus"

# implementation:
# - Use for code-oriented implementation and standard drafting/writing tasks.
# - Recommended default: "sonnet"
implementation = "sonnet"

[execution]
# tdd_default defines the default TDD behavior for the project.
#
# false:
# - TDD is off by default (opt-in model).
# - TDD is used only when a task explicitly sets `TDD: required`
#   or when you change this config to true.
#
# true:
# - TDD is on by default.
# - Tasks using `TDD: inherit` will require a RED->GREEN cycle.
#
# Recommended starting value for your setup: false.
tdd_default = false

# If true, the executor requires minimum RED->GREEN evidence
# for tasks with active TDD (for example: test fails first, then passes).
# This avoids "tests written after the fact" without discipline.
tdd_require_red_green_evidence = true

# If true, the executor blocks batch/wave progression when it finds:
# - missing requirements traceability
# - missing per-task verification
# - critical checkpoint failures
strict_gates = true

[subagents]
# Max number of parallel subagents for web scouting tasks.
# Keep this moderate to avoid noisy/duplicated findings.
max_parallel_web_scouts = 3

# If true, complex/critical tasks in `spw:exec` route spec-compliance review
# to complex_reasoning model. If false, always use implementation model.
use_opus_for_complex_task_review = true

[templates]
# Controls whether the hook syncs tasks-template on SessionStart.
#
# true  -> hook active: choose variant and update tasks-template.md
# false -> hook inactive: do not auto-change the template
sync_tasks_template_on_session_start = true

# Defines how to choose tasks template variant.
#
# Supported values:
# - "auto": decide from [execution].tdd_default
# - "on":   force TDD ON variant
# - "off":  force TDD OFF variant
#
# "auto" is recommended to keep a single source of truth
# in execution.tdd_default.
tasks_template_mode = "auto"

# Path to the directory containing template variants.
# This path is relative to the project root.
# Expected example:
# .spec-workflow/user-templates/variants/
variants_dir = ".spec-workflow/user-templates/variants"

# Path to the active template used by spec-workflow.
# The hook writes here after selecting a variant.
active_tasks_template_path = ".spec-workflow/user-templates/tasks-template.md"

# Variant file name when TDD is ON.
tasks_template_tdd_on_file = "tasks-template.tdd-on.md"

# Variant file name when TDD is OFF.
tasks_template_tdd_off_file = "tasks-template.tdd-off.md"

[safety]
# If true, the hook creates a backup of active template before overwrite.
# Format: tasks-template.md.bak-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
backup_before_overwrite = true

# If true, the hook runs in dry-run mode (does not write files).
# Useful for validating behavior without changing anything.
dry_run = false

# If true, hook exits with code 1 when variant/config is missing.
# If false, it logs a warning and exits without breaking the session.
